        <h2 class="pb-4">Intro</h2>
        <article>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I am Federico Cassano, an international student from Milan.
          I am part of Northeastern University's class of 2025 where I'm studying in the combined major 
          B.S. Cybersecurity and Economics program.
          I am very passionate about all things computers. I started my journey in CS from a very young age
          by coding a gaming server network to now creating machine learning applications, 
          operating systems, compilers, programming languages, web applications and most importantly, security appliances.
          I am also very interested in how corporations and companies manage their assets and how to secure them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I attended a technical institute in Milan as my secondary education, where I studied a mix of mathematics and computer
          science subjects such as programming languages, systems and networks, IT project management, and telecomunications.
          For my final year of high school I attended North Broward Preparatory School as a dorm student to
          strengthen my academic curriculum and study abroad while still being enrolled in my Italian school. In May of
          2021 I graduated NBPS with Excellence Honors in Cybersecurity and Economics, while transitioning to my current university.
        </p>
        </article>

        <p>
        You may wonder how I made this 3D website (enable WebGL in your browser if you can't see it). 
        I used a combination of <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/" target="_blank">three.js</a> and mathematics to 
        create objects, then i made the icons clickable using a ray-casting beam that intercepts those objects. <a class="link-secondary" href="https://github.com/cassanof/personalwebsite" target="_blank">You can find the code for this website here</a>.<br />
        Why the <b>"46"</b> website icon? 46 is the hexadecimal ascii value for the character <b>"F"</b>, which is the initial of my name.
        </p>

        <p>
        Occasionally, I also write guides and writeups on programming-related topics on my blog.<br />
        You can find my blog here: <a class="link-secondary" href="https://blog.federico.codes/" target="_blank">blog.federico.codes</a>
